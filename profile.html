                <p>
                Good design is a homologous process of <b>NAV</b>igating through a <b>maze</b> of environmental needs and principles.
                </p>
<p>
NAV believes that every design and project shall pass through a progress of something in a logical sequence and considering every aspect of it. Visioning each design or project regardless of its size and type should respond, add quality and consider the root to the desired environment so that it would contributes positively - partly if not a whole to the constructible environment.
                </p>
<p>
NAV’s New Architecture Vision design philosophy is a synthesis of range of design ingredients:

<table class="design_philo">
<tr>
    <th style="width:10%">I</th>
    <th style="width:3%">:</th>
     <th style="width:45%">Identity & Innovation</th>
    <th>= traditional to modern</th>
</tr>
<tr>
    <th style="width:10%">C</th>
    <th style="width:3%">:</th>
     <th style="width:45%">Colour</th>
    <th>= light to bright</th>
</tr>
<tr>
    <th style="width:10%">A</th>
    <th style="width:3%">:</th> 
     <th style="width:45%">Articulation</th>
    <th>= simple to complex</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<th style="width:10%">S</th>
    <th style="width:3%">:</th>
     <th style="width:45%">Scale</th>
    <th>= small to big</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<th style="width:10%">T</th>
   <th style="width:3%">:</th>
     <th style="width:45%">Texture</th>
    <th>= smooth to rough</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<th style="width:10%">S</th>
    <th style="width:3%">:</th> 
    <th style="width:45%">Sound/Appearance</th>
    <th>= soft to loud</th>
</tr>
</table>
</p>
<p>
NAV believes that there’s no good design if everything is all traditional, light, simple, small, smooth, soft, etc. Thus, by infusing NAV-iCASTS’ theorem with its design factors and drive to exert the passion will conceive a timeless, innovative and distinguishing design approach that will be surely admired.
